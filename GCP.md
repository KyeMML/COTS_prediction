First stage is to set up a cloud storage bucket to host the available Kaggle data.
Specifically this contained the train_images folder and tran.csv file containing the annotations.  

### The dataset
The dataset includes a folder labelled train_images, containing the images of COTS, as well as a csv file labelled train, containing the annotations of these images. 
The annotations include labelled object detection boxes for COTS in the images.
